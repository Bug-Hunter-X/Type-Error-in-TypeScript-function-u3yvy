# Type Error in TypeScript Function
This repo contains a simple TypeScript program demonstrating a common type error and its solution. The program defines two functions, `add` and `subtract`, which take two numbers as input and return their sum and difference, respectively.  However, an error occurs when calling the `add` function with a string as one of the arguments.
